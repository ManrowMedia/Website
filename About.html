      <h2><b>MANROW MEDIA</b></h2>

      <p>
        Hey there! I’m Jacob, and I love helping small businesses bring their vision to life. 
        I specialize in turning ideas into compelling visual identities using tools and software 
        many businesses might not have in-house. Whether it’s print and digital design, motion 
        graphics, video editing, or beyond, I'm excited to work with you and your brand! Learn more
        about me below! 
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Second block: everything else -->
    <div class="details-block">
      <h3><b>WHY I CREATED MANROW MEDIA</b></h3>
      <p>
        I started Manrow Media to use my skills and creativity to help small businesses succeed. 
        Traditional office roles never provided the connection or purpose I sought, but helping 
        clients bring their creative visions to life always has. Drawing on the skills I developed through a 
        Broadcasting degree from SUNY Oswego and years of real-world work experience in television, marketing, 
        and content creation, I bring creativity, strategy, and polished execution to every 
        project, creating designs that are professional, memorable, and uniquely aligned with 
        each client’s brand.
      </p>

      <h3 class="alt-left"><b>COLLABORATION THAT DELIVERS</b></h3>
      <p class="alt-left">
        Working closely with clients is at the heart of what I do. From the first concept to the final
        delivery, your input is key to the process. I listen, I problem-solve, and I use my experience 
        and creative tools to turn your ideas into results you can see, share, and be proud of.
      </p>

      <h3><b>PHILOSOPHY</b></h3>
      <p>
        I believe creativity thrives in collaboration. By sharing ideas, exploring possibilities, and 
        refining concepts together, we can transform a simple idea into something extraordinary. 
        Every project is a partnership — your vision combined with my expertise and attention to 
        detail.
      </p>
